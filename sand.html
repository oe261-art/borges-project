      "There was no doubt that it had passed through many hands... 'Nineteenth century, probably,' I remarked. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I've never found out.'",
      "I opened the book at random. The script was strange to me... In the upper corners of the pages... one left-hand page bore the number 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999.",
      "I turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries — an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.",
